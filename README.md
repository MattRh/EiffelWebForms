## Installation

 - Run webforms.ecf in EiffelStudio later than 17.1.
 - Give it a moment to compile.
 - Run application.
 - NOTE: application wouldn't work if it is not in the same folder as folder 'stuff/' does
 - P.S. I don't know, does it require installed SQLite on your PC. So if application doesn't work it can be one of the reasons, why
